    like, 78 years to hang a dragon to death. I'm Scary Terry!! You can run
    but you can't hide, bitch!`,

    ya down there for 25 shmeckels! Principal Vagina here, don't let the
    name fool you; I'm very much in charge. Reminding you that tonight is
    our annual flu season dance. I don't know how many times I have to say
    this, but if you have the flu, stay home. The flu season dance is about
    awareness, not celebration. You don't bring dead babies to Passover. I

    off the whitelist. You're our boy dawg, don't even trip. Shadow Jacker,
    you haven't come out of your masturbation cave in eons! What the fuck is

    am not putting my father in a home! He just came back into my life, and
    you want to, grab him and, stuff him under a mattress like last month's
    Victoria's Secret?!`
